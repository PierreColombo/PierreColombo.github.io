<span style="color:red">My R</span>esearch...
------
I hold the position of **<span style="color:navy">Associate Professor</span>** at **<span style="color:darkorange">CentraleSupelec</span>** and serve as the **<span style="color:purple">Chief Science Officer</span>** at **<span style="color:red">[Equall.ai](https://equall.ai/)</span>**, our esteemed legalTech startup. My expertise lies in the forefront of AI advancement, with a particular focus on **<span style="color:blue">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>**.

At **<span style="color:red">[Equall.ai](https://equall.ai/)</span>**, we pioneer the development of AI-driven products meticulously crafted for the legal sector, alongside the formulation of innovative workflows designed to streamline lawyers’ tasks, enabling them to work with <span style="color:darkgreen">unprecedented speed</span> and <span style="color:darkgreen">efficiency</span>.

- We developed the <span style="color:red">**first LLM for Law**</span>!

At **<span style="color:navy">MICS CentraleSupelec - Université ParisSaclay</span>**, my research focuses on making AI usable in NLP industrial systems. I currently focus on:
- <span style="color:blue">**Training large language models**</span> and making them <span style="color:blue">**efficient**</span> for real-world applications.
   - The first LLM in French trained from scratch: [CroissantLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00786.pdf).
   - Achieving near GPT-4 performance on translation with a 7B LLM: [TowerLLM](https://www.dataia.eu/actualites/announcing-tower-open-multilingual-llm-translation-related-tasks).
   - A 175B model trained from scratch: [BLOOM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05100.pdf).
   - Making LLM efficient via [LLM compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12030).
- Ensuring their <span style="color:green">**safety**</span> and <span style="color:green">**robustness**</span>.
   - Making retriever to abstain via [safe text retrieval]().
   - Check our works on LLM and generative models for [translation](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00615/118716), [OOD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09171) and [hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09631).
   - Check our work on safe [text classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09852), [OOD](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/70fa5df8e3300dc30bf19bee44a56155-Abstract-Conference.html) and [adversarial attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14001) .
- and <span style="color:purple">**developing metrics**</span> to ensure accurate measurement of LLM performance.
   - Check our work on metrics for text generation [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14103), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10482), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11646), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12711), [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12463) and our best paper from [AAAI](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21299).
   - Check our work on metric aggregation to make sure you can precisely say which LLM is the best [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10284), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11646), [3](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/ac4920f4085b5662133dd751493946a6-Abstract-Conference.html). 

I am always <span style="color:orange">**happy to discuss new projects and collaborations**</span>.
