In France, the mid term defense takes place 18 months after the beginning of the PhD. The defense is a presentation (20-25' followed by Q&A) to the two external members of the monitoring committee. I had the chance to be examine by [Prof. Alex Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/) and [Prof. Ludovic Denoyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9PLqulwAAAAJ&hl=fr). All slides can be found [here](https://pierrecolombo.github.io//files/mi-parcours.pdf)
