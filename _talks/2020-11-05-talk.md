<p> In France, the midterm defence takes place 18 months after the beginning of the PhD. The defence is a presentation (20-25' followed by Q&A) to the two external members of the monitoring committee. I had the chance to be examined by [Prof. Alex Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/) and [Prof. Ludovic Denoyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9PLqulwAAAAJ&hl=fr). </p>
