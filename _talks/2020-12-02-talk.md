<p>While being an essential component
of spoken language, fillers (e.g. “um”
or “uh”) often remain overlooked in
Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)
tasks. We explore the possibility of
representing them with deep contextualised embeddings, showing improvements on modelling spoken language
and two downstream tasks — predicting a speaker’s stance and expressed
confidence. </p>
